# 🌈 Seasons Slide Project 🌸

I created a project showcasing seasons using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I had the opportunity to enhance my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM). 📚

You can access the live version of the project through the following link: [Live Version](https://sliders-seasons.vercel.app/) 🌍

Feel free to check it out and explore the beauty of nature's changing colors! 🍂🌺🌿
